# Application for ModDash

Users may filter by year, month, and day to view top comments and posts with negative sentiment in that time period. They may also filter by author to view the author's sentiment and scores in the specified time period. In the example below, we are a moderator for the subreddit r/Politics, but this dashboard may change based on the subreddit the moderator is in charge of.
