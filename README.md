## Introduction
Reddit is a social media platform for people to form communities around their personal interests. It has the power to bring people together, but since each user is anonymous, it becomes easier for people to say anything they want -- including the bad stuff. Moderators are created in every subreddit to monitor user activity and ensure people are engaging in civil discussion; however, this can be a time consuming task. In order to make their jobs easier, I created ModDash, a dashboard for moderators to view user history and top posts/comments with negative sentiment. With access to user and comment history, moderators can see whether a specific user frequently engages in toxic behavior and if they may have missed a discussion thread that they didn't notice right away. This dashboard allows mods the freedom to decide what to do given the data: reach out to the user, remove the user from the subreddit, or lock down a thread.
